        This method is wrapped with model(mode='static') decorator meaning
        that model is created in the momment when pipeline.run(...) is called.
        Config attribute is a dictionary that can contain 'loss' and 'path'
        values. If config contains 'path', then model is loaded from directory
        specified by this parameter. Otherwise new keras model is to be built;

        Another key of config dict is 'loss'. Value 'loss' can be one of
        two str: 'dice' or 'tiversky'. This value specifies the loss function
        that will be used during model compilation;

        Args:
        - pipeline: Pipeline object from dataset package; it is the only argument
        and it is used to pass parameters required by model being created
